# Simplex Method Solver in C++

The goal of this project is to create a C++ program that can solve linear programming problems using the Simplex Method. The program should take as input a linear programming problem in standard form and provide the optimal solution and objective value as output.

## Key Features and Functionalities:
- **User Interface:** Implement a simple command-line interface where the user can input the coefficients of the objective function, the constraints, and the Minimum and Maximum choice.
- **Tableau Representation:** Convert the linear programming problem into the standard tableau form, which is a fundamental step in the Simplex Method.
- **Simplex Algorithm:** Implement the Simplex Algorithm to iteratively improve the solution until an optimal solution is reached. This involves selecting entering and leaving variables, performing pivots, and updating the tableau.
- **Optimality and Feasibility Checking:** Incorporate checks to determine if the current solution is optimal or if the problem is infeasible. Terminate the algorithm accordingly.
- **Output:** Display the optimal solution, the objective function value, and any relevant information about the problem's status (optimal, infeasible, unbounded).
